<h3>The Bronx</h3>
</center>
<body>

<p>
All around the world the Bronx is known as the home of the New York Yankees seeing as the Yankee Stadium is located in this borough. 
The Bronx is also known for its Zoo and Botanical Garden which are almost if not more popular than Yankee Stadium. 
The Bronx-specifically the South Bronx is also known as the birthplace of hip-hop. 
The Bronx has received many immigrant groups over the last centuries as it slowly turned into an urban community, the were first from various European countries many were from Ireland, Germany, and Italy. 
Then later the Bronx received more immigrants from the Caribbean such as Puerto Ricans, Jamaicans and Dominicans, as well as African Americans from the southern states. 
The Bronx contains one of the five poorest Congressional Districts in the United States but its wide diversity also includes wealthy, upper-income and middle-income neighborhoods such as Riverdale, Pelham Bay, Morris Park and Country Club.  
Even though the Bronx saw a drastic decline in population, livable housing, and the quality of life in the late 1960s to the 1970s, and a wave of arson. Since then the communities have shown significant redevelopment starting in the late 1980s before picking up pace from the 1990s until today. 
Which is only increasing in percentage due to the wave of gentrification starting to reach this borough.

<h3>How Gentrification is Affecting The Bronx</h3>
</center>
<p>
Although it's not receiving as much gentrification like Brooklyn and Queens the Bronx is getting there. 
According to an article written by C. J. Hughes, “The number of home sales in the Bronx soared in the first quarter of this year by 35 percent, far outpacing Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.” 
Even though this number is smaller in comparison to the numbers that Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens are pulling in. 
This increase in home sales shows that the Bronx might finally be losing the gritty and raw reputation that it once held. 
“Brokers say the sales were not only to buyers moving within the Bronx, but also to people who had been priced out of Manhattan and other areas.” This quote from the article by C. J. Hughes also shows how gentrification really does misplace people because it shows that being out priced really is a con that comes along with gentrification.
